</a>

In this system we derive system to these two (micro)services:

- Authentication Service: authentication & authorization will be handled by this service.
- Ordering Service: browsing product catalog, create an order, manage order's status, etc will be handled by this service.
- Shipment Service: once order's been created, they need to be managed and ship to the customer and that's responsibility for this service.
- Inventory Service: product inventory will be managed inside this service.

### Prerequisites

All you need is Docker with Docker Compose enabled.
